When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So that multiple people can work on my project.
    So that i can access the proect from different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually makes you resolve merge conflicts whenever you are ready to do so.
    Inspecting an older version of the code might be usefull sometimes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks:
    A copy of an existing GitHub repository on GutHub.
    Clones:
    A copy of an existing GitHub/local repository on your machine.
    Branches:
    Different development branches, within one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    'git fetch'
    it enables you to postpone merging right away. 
    You can use 'git diff' to compare the current remote version with you local branch, without having internet access.
